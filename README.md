# College Algebra with Python (Web Demo)

This project demonstrates core college algebra concepts inspired by Python, implemented in a modern, night-blue themed web page using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No terminal or installation required—just open the HTML file in your browser.

## Features
- **Algebraic and graphical representations**: Simulated with interactive forms and visualizations inspired by Python workflows.
- **Equation solving**: Includes quadratic and linear systems solvers, plus step-by-step equation resolution.
- **Modern, responsive design**: Night-blue color palette and user-friendly interface.

## Included Projects
- **Quadratic Function Calculator**: Enter coefficients, get real roots and see the graph of the quadratic function.
- **Linear System Simulator**: Solve 2x2 linear systems interactively.
- **Step-by-Step Equation Solver**: Enter a linear equation (ax + b = c) and see the solution process.

## How to use this project?
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `algebra_index.html` in your browser.
3. Interact with the tools directly—no setup or terminal needed.

## File Structure
- `algebra_index.html`: Main HTML file with the interface.
- `algebra_styles.css`: Modern night-blue styles for a clean look.
- `algebra_app.js`: All interactive logic and visualization code.

## Customization
You can easily add more algebra tools, change styles, or expand the logic by editing the JavaScript and CSS files. You can also adapt the logic to support more complex equations or visualizations.
